# Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (NVIDIA 50xx Ready ISO)

This is a **custom Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS ISO** (desktop, amd64) with **NVIDIA 570 Open drivers preinstalled** ‚Äî tailored for PCs with **NVIDIA 50xx series GPUs** and **no integrated graphics**.

---

### ‚ùó Why This ISO?

If you try to install the **official Ubuntu 22.04 ISO** on a system with only an **NVIDIA 50xx GPU** (e.g., RTX 5070 Ti) and **no integrated GPU**, you'll most likely get a **black screen** right after boot. This happens because the default ISO lacks drivers compatible with these new-generation GPUs.

This custom ISO **fixes that issue** by preloading the correct **NVIDIA 570 open-source driver**, letting you boot and install without trouble.
